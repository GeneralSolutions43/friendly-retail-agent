# Spec: Improve Chat Input Text Visibility

## Overview
The text entered into the chat input field is currently too light and difficult to see against the white background. This track aims to improve visibility by increasing the contrast of both the typed text and the placeholder text.

## Functional Requirements
- **Typed Text Color:** Update the input field text color to `text-zinc-900`.
- **Placeholder Text Color:** Update the placeholder text color to `placeholder:text-zinc-500`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Text entered into the chat input is clearly visible and has high contrast (zinc-900).
- [ ] The placeholder text "Type your message..." is more visible (zinc-500).
- [ ] The input field remains responsive and functional.

## Out of Scope
- Changing the overall shape or size of the input field.
- Modifying the styling of the "Send" button.
